# Flame-of-the-West
This project showcases the collaborative efforts of four Microsoft Software & Systems Academy Students to create a simple Lord of the Rings Themed game.
The project team (Florabel Ituralde, Tyler Kain, Kyle Dailey and Tim Tieng) will be using fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming through use of 
C# throughout this project. The overall endstate of this collaborative project is to gain hands on experience with modern Development Team processes, demonstrating our knowledge with C#, and to increase our desire to learn more!
